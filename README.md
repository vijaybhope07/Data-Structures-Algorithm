Downloads and release artifacts
The repository links to a Releases page with binary and source artifacts. Because the link points to a Releases page, download the release asset that matches your operating system and run the installer or executable to set up a local environment. If you prefer a source build, download the source archive and compile with your toolchain. The Releases page provides the files for different platforms, so choose the one appropriate for your setup. For convenience, you can visit the Releases section directly to view all assets and their descriptions.

If you want a quick way to access release assets, use the badge above to jump to the downloads page. The assets typically include a ready-to-run executable, libraries, and sometimes sample data for quick experimentation. After downloading, follow the included instructions to install or run the binary. If a particular asset requires a specific runtime, ensure you have the corresponding runtime installed (for example, a compatible C++ standard library version or a Windows Visual C++ runtime).

What this repository covers
- Core data structures: arrays, strings, linked lists (singly and doubly), stacks, queues, trees (binary search trees, AVL trees, segment trees), graphs, hash tables, and heaps.
- Essential algorithms: sorting (quick sort, merge sort, heap sort, stable sorts), searching (binary search, interpolation search), traversals (preorder, inorder, postorder, level order), graph algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, Kruskal, Prim), dynamic programming, greedy methods, backtracking, and recursion patterns.
- Practical LeetCode solutions: user-friendly implementations that map to common LeetCode problem types, with clean interfaces and concise explanations, designed to help you understand the approach and adapt it to variations.
- Patterns and problem solving: two-pointers, sliding window, monotonic stacks, recursion vs. iteration, memoization, state machines, and template-driven problem solving.
- Learning paths: structured sections to help you progress from fundamental data structures to advanced algorithms, with example problems and test cases.

Why this repository exists
- Clarity and practicality: code is organized for quick reading, easy reuse, and straightforward testing. Explanations accompany code, focusing on the “why” behind the approach.
- Interview readiness: the collection emphasizes common patterns seen in interviews and on LeetCode, with explanations that help you articulate your reasoning.
- Hands-on learning: examples are designed to be runnable with minimal boilerplate. You can drop snippets into your own projects and extend them as needed.
- Consistent style: a single, coherent coding and documentation style across topics makes it easier to learn and compare ideas.

How to get started
- Prerequisites: a modern C++ compiler with support for C++17 or newer, and a build system such as CMake or a suitable IDE. Some examples may assume a Unix-like environment; Windows users can rely on MSVC or MinGW-w64 with CMake support.
- Clone the repository:
  - git clone https://github.com/Ghost4474/Data-Structures-Algorithm.git
- Build from the command line (CMake):
  - mkdir -p Data-Structures-Algorithm/build
  - cd Data-Structures-Algorithm/build
  - cmake ..
  - cmake --build . --config Release -- -j
  - On Windows, use cmake --build . --config Release to build with MSVC; choose the Release configuration in your IDE.
- Run examples:
  - The build artifacts include sample executables. Run them directly from the build directory, or navigate to the specific example you want to exercise.
- Using the code in your own projects:
  - Include headers from the include directory and link against the built libraries if the project provides them. Start with a small main program that exercises the particular data structure or algorithm you’re studying.

LeetCode solutions organized by topic
- Organized problem sets by category, difficulty, and core technique.
- Each solution emphasizes:
  - Problem understanding
  - Key insight or invariant
  - Step-by-step approach
  - Complexity analysis
  - Clean, reusable code structure
- Example problem families you’ll find:
  - Two pointers and sliding window problems
  - Dynamic programming challenges
  - Graph traversal and pathfinding problems
  - Tree traversal and manipulation problems
  - Hash and counting problems
- How to adapt solutions
  - Identify the core pattern
  - Map problem constraints to a known approach
  - Adjust for edge cases and performance requirements
- How to test
  - Small, focused unit tests for typical cases and corner cases
  - Randomized tests to verify invariants
  - Stress tests to compare with reference implementations

Code style and guidelines
- Language level: C++17 or newer
- Naming conventions: clear, descriptive names; types in PascalCase or CamelCase; functions and variables in camelCase or snake_case, depending on submodule conventions.
- Documentation: every public-facing API has a short description and usage examples.
- Testing: tests exercise edge cases and typical scenarios; tests are easy to run and understand.
- Dependencies: minimal external dependencies; standard library only when possible.
- Performance mindset: algorithms are implemented with careful attention to time and space complexity, with comments explaining trade-offs.

Usage examples and quick references
- Dynamic arrays
  - Use std::vector for dynamic arrays; reserve capacity when you know the size to minimize reallocations.
  - Example: auto vec = std::vector<int>(); vec.push_back(1); vec.push_back(2);
- Linked lists
  - Implementations focus on insertion and deletion near head or tail; consider pointer stability and memory reuse.
  - Example: a singly linked list where you can insert after a given node with ll.insertAfter(node, value).
- Trees
  - Balanced trees help with predictable performance; understanding rotations is crucial for maintaining balance.
  - Example: a binary search tree supports insert and find in O(log n) on average with a balanced tree.
- Graphs
  - Adjacency lists are memory-efficient for sparse graphs; DFS and BFS form the basis for many problems.
  - Example: perform a BFS from a start node to compute shortest distances in an unweighted graph.
